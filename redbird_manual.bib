Based on the results of these trials, there is increased interest in offering screening MRI to high-risk women after discussion of the potential benefits and risks. The benefits include increased cancer detection with MRI and significantly more cancers detected prior to nodal metastases. The risks include false-positive exams, which lead to additional imaging and/or benign biopsies. This article will review the findings from published clinical trials and provide guidelines for implementation of an MRI screening program. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Combinations of these domains can yield either additive or wholly new information, depending on whether one domain interacts with the other. In this report, we describe a new approach to breast imaging based on the interaction between controlled applied mechanical force and tissue hemodynamics. Presented is a description of the system design, performance characteristics, and representative clinical findings for a second-generation dynamic near-infrared optical tomographic breast imager that examines both breasts simultaneously, under conditions of rest and controlled mechanical provocation. The expected capabilities and limitations of the developed system are described in relation to the various sensing domains for breast imaging. {\textcopyright} 2011 Optical Society of America.},

Distribution or reproduction of this work in whole or in part requires full attribution of the original publication, including its DOI. Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a wide-field diffuse optical technique used to obtain optical properties and chromophore concentrations in highly scattering media, such as biological tissue. Here, we present a method for rapidly acquiring multispectral SFDI data by modulating each illumination wavelength at a different temporal frequency. In the remitted signal, each wavelength is temporally demodulated and processed using conventional SFDI techniques. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept system capable of acquiring wide-field maps (2048×1536 pixels, 8.5×6.4 cm) of optical properties at three wavelengths in under 2.5 s. Data acquired by this method show a good agreement with a commercial SFDI imaging system (with an average error of 13{\%} in absorption and 8{\%} in scattering). Additionally, we show that this strategy is insensitive to ambient lighting conditions, making it more practical for clinical translation. In the future, this technique could be expanded to tens or hundreds of wavelengths without increasing acquisition time.},

abstract = {We present a novel methodology for combining breast image data obtained at different times, in different geometries, and by different techniques. We combine data based on diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The software platform integrates advanced multimodal registration and segmentation algorithms, requires minimal user experience, and employs computationally efficient techniques. The resulting superposed 3-D tomographs facilitate tissue analyses based on structural and functional data derived from both modalities, and readily permit enhancement of DOT data reconstruction using MRI-derived a-priori structural information. We demonstrate the multimodal registration method using a simulated phantom, and we present initial patient studies that confirm that tumorous regions in a patient breast found by both imaging modalities exhibit significantly higher total hemoglobin concentration (THC) than surrounding normal tissues. The average THC in the tumorous regions is one to three standard deviations larger than the overall breast average THC for all patients.},

By using pairs of illumination-detection patterns with a single detector, we were able to perform high-resolution quantitative volumetric imaging of absorption heterogeneities embedded in optically thick samples. Additionally, a tomographic reconstruction algorithm was implemented on a graphical processor unit to provide optical reconstructions at a frame rate of 2 Hz. The structured illumination method proposed in this work has significant cost advantages over camera systems, as only a single detector is required. This configuration also has the potential to increase frame rate.},

To enable tissue function-based tumor diagnosis over the large number of existing digital mammography systems worldwide, we propose a cost-effective and robust approach to incorporate tomographic optical tissue characterization with separately acquired digital mammograms. Using a flexible contour-based registration algorithm, we were able to incorporate an independently measured two-dimensional x-ray mammogram as structural priors in a joint optical/x-ray image reconstruction, resulting in improved spatial details in the optical images and robust optical property estimation. We validated this approach with a retrospective clinical study of 67 patients, including 30 malignant and 37 benign cases, and demonstrated that the proposed approach can help to distinguish malignant from solid benign lesions and fibroglandular tissues, with a performance comparable to the approach using spatially coregistered optical/x-ray measurements.},

This new system was deployed in a previously existing system for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided spectroscopy, and allows incorporation of additional near-infrared wavelengths beyond 850 nm, with interlaced channels of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photodiodes (PDs). The acquisition time for obtaining frequency-domain data at six wavelengths (660, 735, 785, 808, 826, and 849 nm) and continuous-wave data at three wavelengths (903, 912, and 948 nm) is 12 min. The dynamic ranges of the detected signal are 105 and 106 for PMT and PD detectors, respectively. Compared to the previous detection system, the SNR ratio of frequency-domain detection was improved by nearly 103 through the addition of an RF amplifier and the utilization of programmable gain. The current system is being utilized in a clinical trial imaging suspected breast cancer tumors as detected by contrast MRI scans. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.},

abstract = {Screening X-ray mammography is limited by false positives and negatives leading to unnecessary physical and psychological morbidity. Diffuse Optical Imaging using harmless near infra red light, provides lesion detection based on functional abnormalities and represents a novel diagnostic arm that could complement traditional mammography. Reviews of optical breast imaging have not been systematic, are focused mainly on technological developments, and have become superseded by rapid technological advancement. The aim of this study is to review clinically orientated studies involving approximately 2,000 women in whom optical mammography has been used to evaluate the healthy or diseased breast. The results suggest that approximately 85{\%} of breast lesions are detectable on optical mammography. Spectroscopic resolution of tissue haemoglobin composition and oxygen saturation may improve the detectability of breast diseases. Results suggest that breast lesions contain approximately twice the haemoglobin concentration of background tissue. Current evidence suggests that it is not possible to distinguish benign from malignant disease using optical imaging techniques in isolation. Methods to improve the performance of Diffuse Optical Imaging, such as better spectral coverage with additional wavelengths, improved modelling of light transport in tissues and the use of extrinsic dyes may augment lesion detection and characterisation. Future research should involve large clinical trials to determine the overall sensitivity and specificity of optical imaging techniques as well as to establish patient satisfaction and economic viability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (i.e., oxygenation) is a functional imaging endpoint that can reveal variations in tissue hypoxia, which may be predictive of pathologic response in subjects undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this study, we used diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging (DOSI) to measure concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (ctO2Hb), deoxy-hemoglobin (ctHHb), total Hb (ctTHb = ctO2Hb + ctHHb), and oxygen saturation (stO2 = ctO2Hb/ctTHb) in tumor and contralateral normal tissue from 41 patients with locally advanced primary breast cancer. Measurements were acquired before the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Optically derived parameters were analyzed separately and in combination with clinical biomarkers to evaluate correlations with pathologic response. Discriminant analysis was conducted to determine the ability of optical and clinical biomarkers to classify subjects into response groups. Twelve (28.6{\%}) of 42 tumors achieved pathologic complete response (pCR) and 30 (71.4{\%}) were non-pCR. Tumor measurements in pCR subjects had higher stO2 levels (median 77.8{\%}) than those in non-pCR individuals (median 72.3{\%}, P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in baseline ctO2Hb, ctHHb, and ctTHb between response groups. An optimal tumor oxygenation threshold of stO 2 = 76.7{\%} was determined for pCR versus non-pCR (sensitivity = 75.0{\%}, specificity = 73.3{\%}). Multivariate discriminant analysis combining estrogen receptor staining and stO2 further improved the classification of pCR versus non-pCR (sensitivity = 100{\%}, specificity = 85.7{\%}). These results show that elevated baseline tumor stO2 are correlated with a pCR. Noninvasive DOSI scans combined with histopathology subtyping may aid in stratification of individual patients with breast cancer before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. {\textcopyright}2012 AACR.},

Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is emerging as a noninvasive functional imaging method for breast cancer diagnosis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring. In particular, the multimodal approach of combining DOT with x-ray digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is especially synergistic as DBT prior information can be used to enhance the DOT reconstruction. DOT, in turn, provides a functional information overlay onto the mammographic images, increasing sensitivity and specificity to cancer pathology. We describe a dynamic DOT apparatus designed for tight integration with commercial DBT scanners and providing a fast (up to 1 Hz) image acquisition rate to enable tracking hemodynamic changes induced by the mammographic breast compression. The system integrates 96 continuous-wave and 24 frequency-domain source locations as well as 32 continuous wave and 20 frequency-domain detection locations into low-profile plastic plates that can easily mate to the DBT compression paddle and x-ray detector cover, respectively. We demonstrate system performance using static and dynamic tissue-like phantoms as well as in vivo images acquired from the pool of patients recalled for breast biopsies at the Massachusetts General Hospital Breast Imaging Division.},

@article{Autier2012,
abstract = {In this article, we discuss the most common epidemiological methods used for evaluating the ability of mammography screening to decrease the risk of breast cancer death in general populations (effectiveness). Case-control studies usually find substantial effectiveness. However when breast cancer mortality decreases for reasons unrelated to screening, the case-control design may attribute to screening mortality reductions due to other causes. Studies based on incidence-based mortality have obtained contrasted results compatible with modest to considerable effectiveness, probably because of differences in study design and statistical analysis. In areas where screening has been widespread for a long time, the incidence of advanced breast cancer should be decreasing, which in turn would translate into reduced mortality. However, no or modest declines in the incidence of advanced breast cancer has been observed in these areas. Breast cancer mortality should decrease more rapidly in areas with early introduction of screening than in areas with late introduction of screening. Nonetheless, no difference in breast mortality trends has been observed between areas with early or late screening start. When effectiveness is assessed using incidence-based mortality studies, or the monitoring of advanced cancer incidence, or trends in mortality, the ecological bias is an inherent limitation that is not easy to control. Minimization of this bias requires data over long periods of time, careful selection of populations being compared and availability of data on major confounding factors. If case-control studies seem apparently more adequate for evaluating screening effectiveness, this design has its own limitations and results must be viewed with caution.See related Opinion article: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/106 and Commentary http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/10/164.},

These values are comparable to estimates obtained from previously published positron emission tomography (PET) measurements. We conclude that compression-induced changes in breast physiological properties are significant and should be accounted for when performing optical breast imaging. Additionally, the dynamic characteristics of the changes in breast physiological parameters, together with the ability to probe the tissue metabolic state, may prove useful for breast cancer detection.},

abstract = {Near infrared dynamic diffuse optical tomography measurements of breast hemodynamics during fractional mammographic compression offer a novel contrast mechanism for detecting breast cancer and monitoring chemotherapy. Tissue viscoelastic relaxation during the compression period leads to a slow reduction in the compression force and reveals biomechanical and metabolic differences between healthy and lesion tissue. We measured both the absolute values and the temporal evolution of hemoglobin concentration during 25-35 N of compression for 22 stage II and III breast cancer patients scheduled to undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 17 patients were included in the group analysis (average tumor size 3.2 cm, range: 1.3-5.7 cm). We observed a statistically significant differential decrease in total and oxy-hemoglobin, as well as in hemoglobin oxygen saturation in tumor areas vs. healthy tissue, as early as 30 seconds into the compression period. The hemodynamic contrast is likely driven by the higher tumor stiffness and different viscoelastic relaxation rate, as well as the higher tumor oxygen metabolism rate. {\textcopyright} 2013 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {With the effectiveness of therapeutic agents ever decreasing and the increased incidence of multi-drug resistant pathogens, there is a clear need for administration of more potent, potentially more toxic, drugs. Alternatively, biopharmaceuticals may hold potential but require specialised protection from premature in vivo degradation. Thus, a paralleled need for specialised drug delivery systems has arisen. Although cell-mediated drug delivery is not a completely novel concept, the few applications described to date are not yet ready for in vivo application, for various reasons such as drug-induced carrier cell death, limited control over the site and timing of drug release and/or drug degradation by the host immune system. Here, we present our hypothesis for a new drug delivery system, which aims to negate these limitations. We propose transport of nanoparticle-encapsulated drugs inside autologous macrophages polarised to M1 phenotype for high mobility and treated to induce transient phagosome maturation arrest. In addition, we propose a significant shift of existing paradigms in the study of host-microbe interactions, in order to study microbial host immune evasion and dissemination patterns for their therapeutic utilisation in the context of drug delivery. We describe a system in which microbial strategies may be adopted to facilitate absolute control over drug delivery, and without sacrificing the host carrier cells. We provide a comprehensive summary of the lessons we can learn from microbes in the context of drug delivery and discuss their feasibility for in vivo therapeutic application. We then describe our proposed “synthetic microbe drug delivery system” in detail. In our opinion, this multidisciplinary approach may hold the solution to effective, controlled drug delivery.},

abstract = {Purpose: To prospectively determine the diagnostic accuracy of optical absorption imaging in patients with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3-5 breast lesions. Materials and methods: Forty-six patients with BI-RADS classification 3 (11{\%}), 4 (44{\%}) or 5 (44{\%}) lesions, underwent a novel optical imaging examination using red light to illuminate the breast. Pressure was applied on the breast, and time-dependent curves of light absorption were recorded. Curves that consistently increased or decreased over time were classified as suspicious for malignancy. All patients underwent a core or surgical biopsy. Results: Optical mammography showed a statistical difference in numbers of suspect pixels between benign (N = 12) and malignant (N = 35) lesions (respectively 1325 vs. 3170, P = 0.002). In this population, optical imaging had a sensitivity of 74{\%}, specificity of 92{\%}, and diagnostic accuracy of 79{\%}. The optical signal did not vary according to any other parameter including breast size or density, age, hormonal status or histological type of lesions. Conclusion: Optical imaging is a low-cost, non-invasive technique, yielding physiological information dependent on breast blood volume and oxygenation. It appears to have a good potential for discriminating benign from malignant lesions. Further studies are warranted to define its potential role in breast cancer imaging. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present the clinical implementation of a novel hybrid system that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and near-infrared (NIR) optical measurements for the noninvasive study of breast cancer in vivo. Fourteen patients were studied with a MR-NIR prototype imager and spectrometer. A diffuse optical tomographic scheme employed the MR images as a priori information to implement an image-guided NIR localized spectroscopic scheme. All patients who entered the study also underwent gadolinium-enhanced MRI and biopsy so that the optical findings were cross-validated with MR readings and histopathology. The technique quantified the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin of five malignant and nine benign breast lesions in vivo. Breast cancers were found with decreased oxygen saturation and higher blood concentration than most benign lesions. The average hemoglobin concentration ([H]) of cancers was 0.130+/-0.100 mM, and the average hemoglobin saturation (Y) was 60+/-9{\%} compared to [H]=0.018+/-0.005 mM and Y=69+/-6{\%} of background tissue. Fibroadenomas exhibited high hemoglobin concentration [H]=0.060+/-0.010 mM and mild decrease in oxygen saturation Y=67+/-2{\%}. Cysts and other normal lesions were easily differentiated based on intrinsic contrast information. This novel optical technology can be a significant add-on in MR examinations and can be used to characterize functional parameters of cancers with diagnostic and treatment prognosis potential. It is foreseen that the technique can play a major role in functional activation studies of brain and muscle as well.},

abstract = {Image reconstruction in optical tomography is a nonlinear and generally ill-posed inverse problem. Noise in the measured surface data can give rise to substantial artifacts in the recovered volume images of optical coefficients. Apart from random shot noise caused by the limited number of photons detected at the measurement site, another class of systematic noise is associated with losses specific to individual source and detector locations. A common cause for such losses in data acquisition systems based on fiber-optic light delivery is the imperfect coupling between the fiber tips and the skin of the patient because of air gaps or surface moisture. Thus the term coupling errors was coined for this type of data noise. However, source and detector specific errors can also occur in noncontact measurement systems not using fiber-optic delivery, for example, owing to local skin pigmentation, hair and hair follicles, or instrumentation calibration errors. Often it is not possible to quantify coupling effects in a way that allows us to remove them from the data or incorporate them into the light transport model. We present an alternative method of eliminating coupling errors by regarding the complex-valued coupling factors for each source and detector as unknowns in the reconstruction process and recovering them simultaneously with the images of absorption and scattering. Our method takes into account the possibility that coupling effects have an influence on both the amplitude and the phase shift of the measurements. Reconstructions from simulated and experimental phantom data are presented, which show that including the coupling coefficients in the reconstruction greatly improves the recovery of absorption and scattering images. {\textcopyright} 2007 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {Differentiation among malignant tumors, benign tumors, and normal tissue is highly important in the diagnosis and treatment of many malignancies. We have proposed a dynamic schema for noninvasive characterization of pressure-induced changes in solid tumors. Our hypothesis has been that the altered neovascularization processes within cancer-bearing tissues may significantly increase vascular resistance and cause a much slower response of hemoglobin concentration during a dynamic compression stimulus. This hypothesis was tested by the evaluation of data generated from human tumor clinical testing and from animal tumor model testing. In the human tumor clinical testing, a unified diagnostic criterion was derived that integrated the relative characteristics of tumor oxygen, hemoglobin, and hemoglobin dynamics. By applying such a unified criterion, we were able to differentiate benign breast lesions and malignant breast tumors with high sensitivity and specificity within a subset of 14 suspicious breast lesions with similar size and depth characteristics. In the animal testing, a stepped compression load was applied to the subcutaneous tumor deposit on an athymic NU/NU nude mouse model with subcutaneous xenograft BxPC-3 cancer. Characteristic differences were observed between the premortem tumor and the postmortem tumor in terms of pressure-induced tumor structural and functional changes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Optical Society of America.},

Incidence data, available through 2015, were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data, available through 2016, were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2019, 1,762,450 new cancer cases and 606,880 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Over the past decade of data, the cancer incidence rate (2006-2015) was stable in women and declined by approximately 2{\%} per year in men, whereas the cancer death rate (2007-2016) declined annually by 1.4{\%} and 1.8{\%}, respectively. The overall cancer death rate dropped continuously from 1991 to 2016 by a total of 27{\%}, translating into approximately 2,629,200 fewer cancer deaths than would have been expected if death rates had remained at their peak. Although the racial gap in cancer mortality is slowly narrowing, socioeconomic inequalities are widening, with the most notable gaps for the most preventable cancers. For example, compared with the most affluent counties, mortality rates in the poorest counties were 2-fold higher for cervical cancer and 40{\%} higher for male lung and liver cancers during 2012-2016. Some states are home to both the wealthiest and the poorest counties, suggesting the opportunity for more equitable dissemination of effective cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies. A broader application of existing cancer control knowledge with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups would undoubtedly accelerate progress against cancer.},

abstract = {Structured-light systems are simple and effective tools to acquire 3D models. Built with off-the-shelf components, a data projector and a camera, they are easy to deploy and compare in precision with expensive laser scanners. But such a high precision is only possible if camera and projector are both accurately calibrated. Robust calibration methods are well established for cameras but, while cameras and projectors can both be described with the same mathematical model, it is not clear how to adapt these methods to projectors. In consequence, many of the proposed projector calibration techniques make use of a simplified model, neglecting lens distortion, resulting in loss of precision. In this paper, we present a novel method to estimate the image coordinates of 3D points in the projector image plane. The method relies on an uncalibrated camera and makes use of local homographies to reach sub-pixel precision. As a result, any camera model can be used to describe the projector, including the extended pinhole model with radial and tangential distortion coefficients, or even those with more complex lens distortion models.},

In this work, we have developed a dual-camera structured light imaging (SLI) breast shape acquisition system tailored for a mammography-like compression setting. Illumination pattern intensity is dynamically adjusted to account for skin tone differences, while thickness-informed pattern masking reduces artifacts due to specular reflections. This compact system is affixed to a rigid mount that can be installed into existing mammography or parallel-plate DOT systems without the need for camera-projector re-calibration. Our SLI system produces sub-millimeter resolution with a mean surface error of 0.26 mm. This breast shape acquisition system results in more accurate surface recovery, with an average 1.6-fold reduction in surface estimation errors over a reference method via contour extrusion. Such improvement translates to 25\&\#x0025; to 50\&\#x0025; reduction in mean squared error in the recovered absorption coefficient for a series of simulated tumors 1-2 cm below the skin.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3-D) imaging system based on Gray-code projection isdescribed; it is thought to be used as an integration to the already developedprofilometer based on the projection of multifrequency gratings. The Gray-codemethod allows us to evaluate the 3-D profile of objects that present evenmarked discontinuities of the surface, thus increasing the flexibility of themeasuring system as to the topology of the objects that can be measured. Thebasic aspects of Gray-code projection for 3-D imaging and profiling arediscussed, with particular emphasis devoted to the study of the resolution ofthe method and to the analysis of the systematic errors. The results of thisstudy allow us to determine the optimal setting of the parameters of themeasurement and to develop a suitable calibration procedure. The proceduresfor implementing the Gray-code method are presented, and some interestingexperimental results are reported. Calibration of the system reveals anaccuracy of 0.2 mm, corresponding to 0.1\% of the field of view.},

abstract = { PurposeTo explore the optical and physiologic properties of normal and lesion-bearing breasts by using a combined optical and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging system.Materials and MethodsInstitutional review board approval and patient informed consent were obtained for this HIPAA-compliant study. Combined optical and tomosynthesis imaging analysis was performed in 189 breasts from 125 subjects (mean age, 56 years ± 13 [standard deviation]), including 138 breasts with negative findings and 51 breasts with lesions. Three-dimensional (3D) maps of total hemoglobin concentration (HbT), oxygen saturation (So2), and tissue reduced scattering coefficients were interpreted by using the coregistered DBT images. Paired and unpaired t tests were performed between various tissue types to identify significant differences.ResultsThe estimated average bulk HbT from 138 normal breasts was 19.2 μmol/L. The corresponding mean So2 was 0.73, within the range of values in the literature. A linear correlation (R = 0.57, P < .0001) was found between HbT and the fibroglandular volume fraction derived from the 3D DBT scans. Optical reconstructions of normal breasts revealed structures corresponding to chest-wall muscle, fibroglandular, and adipose tissues in the HbT, So2, and scattering images. In 26 malignant tumors of 0.6–2.5 cm in size, HbT was significantly greater than that in the fibroglandular tissue of the same breast (P = .0062). Solid benign lesions (n = 17) and cysts (n = 8) had significantly lower HbT contrast than did the malignant lesions (P = .025 and P = .0033, respectively).ConclusionThe optical and DBT images were structurally consistent. The malignant tumors and benign lesions demonstrated different HbT and scattering contrasts, which can potentially be exploited to reduce the false-positive rate of conventional mammography and unnecessary biopsies.© RSNA, 2010Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.10082176/-/DC1 }

The L-curve thus gives insight into the regularizing properties of the underlying regularization method, and it is an aid in choosing an appropriate regularization parameter for the given data.

This Poisson formulation considers all the points at once, without resorting to heuristic spatial partitioning or blending, and is therefore highly resilient to data noise. Unlike radial basis function schemes, our Poisson approach allows a hierarchy of locally supported basis functions, and therefore the solution reduces to a well conditioned sparse linear system. We describe a spatially adaptive multiscale algorithm whose time and space complexities are proportional to the size of the reconstructed model. Experimenting with publicly available scan data, we demonstrate reconstruction of surfaces with greater detail than previously achievable.},

   abstract = {The development of effective multi-modality imaging methods typically requires an efficient information fusion model, particularly when combining structural images with a complementary imaging modality that provides functional information. We propose a composition-based image segmentation method for X-ray digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and a structural-prior-guided image reconstruction for a combined DBT and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) breast imaging system. Using the 3D DBT images from 31 clinically measured healthy breasts, we create an empirical relationship between the X-ray intensities for adipose and fibroglandular tissue. We use this relationship to then segment another 58 healthy breast DBT images from 29 subjects into compositional maps of different tissue types. For each breast, we build a weighted-graph in the compositional space and construct a regularization matrix to incorporate the structural priors into a finite-element-based DOT image reconstruction. Use of the compositional priors enables us to fuse tissue anatomy into optical images with less restriction than when using a binary segmentation. This allows us to recover the image contrast captured by DOT but not by DBT. We show that it is possible to fine-tune the strength of the structural priors by changing a single regularization parameter. By estimating the optical properties for adipose and fibroglandular tissue using the proposed algorithm, we found the results are comparable or superior to those estimated with expert-segmentations, but does not involve the time-consuming manual selection of regions-of- interest. © 2010 Optical Society of America.},

In 2024, 2,001,140 new cancer cases and 611,720 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer mortality continued to decline through 2021, averting over 4 million deaths since 1991 because of reductions in smoking, earlier detection for some cancers, and improved treatment options in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings. However, these gains are threatened by increasing incidence for 6 of the top 10 cancers. Incidence rates increased during 2015–2019 by 0.6%–1% annually for breast, pancreas, and uterine corpus cancers and by 2%–3% annually for prostate, liver (female), kidney, and human papillomavirus‐associated oral cancers and for melanoma. Incidence rates also increased by 1%–2% annually for cervical (ages 30–44 years) and colorectal cancers (ages <55 years) in young adults. Colorectal cancer was the fourth‐leading cause of cancer death in both men and women younger than 50 years in the late‐1990s but is now first in men and second in women. Progress is also hampered by wide persistent cancer disparities; compared to White people, mortality rates are two‐fold higher for prostate, stomach and uterine corpus cancers in Black people and for liver, stomach, and kidney cancers in Native American people. Continued national progress will require increased investment in cancer prevention and access to equitable treatment, especially among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals.},

One of these errors is the calibration of the emitter strength and detector efficiency/gain. While in principle these parameters can be determined accurately prior to an imaging experiment, slight fluctuations will cause significant image artifacts. For this reason, it is necessary to consider including their calibration as part of the inverse problem for image reconstruction. In this paper, we show that this can be done successfully in a linear reconstruction model with simulated continuous-wave data. The technique is general for frequency and time domain data. (},

   abstract = {Multiple studies in the first decade of the 21st century have established contrast-enhanced breast MRI as a screening modality for women with a hereditary or familial increased risk for the development of breast cancer. In recent studies, in women with various risk profiles, the sensitivity ranges between 81% and 100%, which is approximately twice as high as the sensitivity of mammography. The specificity increases in follow-up rounds to around 97%, with positive predictive values for biopsy in the same range as for mammography. MRI preferentially detects the more aggressive/invasive types of breast cancer, but has a higher sensitivity than mammography for any type of cancer. This performance implies that in women screened with breast MRI, all other examinations must be regarded as supplemental. Mammography may yield ~5% additional cancers, mostly ductal carcinoma in situ, while slightly decreasing specificity and increasing the costs. Ultrasound has no supplemental value when MRI is used. Evidence is mounting that in other groups of women the performance of MRI is likewise superior to more conventional screening techniques. Particularly in women with a personal history of breast cancer, the gain seems to be high, but also in women with a biopsy history of lobular carcinoma in situ and even women at average risk, similar results are reported. Initial outcome studies show that breast MRI detects cancer earlier, which induces a stage-shift increasing the survival benefit of screening. Cost-effectiveness is still an issue, particularly for women at lower risk. Since costs of the MRI scan itself are a driving factor, efforts to reduce these costs are essential. The use of abbreviated MRI protocols may enable more widespread use of breast MRI for screening. Level of Evidence: 1. Technical Efficacy: Stage 5. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2019;50:377–390.},

Although studies have proven its accuracy in detection of the primary tumor and axillary staging, its most important current clinical application is in detection and defining the extent of recurrent or metastatic breast cancer and for monitoring response to therapy. PET is complementary to conventional methods of staging in that it provides better sensitivity in detecting nodal and lytic bone metastases; however, it should not be considered a substitute for conventional staging studies, including computed tomography and bone scintigraphy. FDG uptake in the primary tumor carries prognostic information, but the underlying biochemical mechanisms responsible for enhanced glucose metabolism have not been completely elucidated. Future work using other PET tracers besides FDG will undoubtedly help our understanding of tumor biology and help tailor therapy to individual patient by improving our ability to quantify the therapeutic target, identify drug resistance factors, and measure and predict early response. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The association of changes in metastatic breast cancer treatment with improved breast cancer mortality is unclear. Objective: To simulate the relative associations of breast cancer screening, treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and treatment of metastatic breast cancer with improved breast cancer mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Using aggregated observational and clinical trial data on the dissemination and effects of screening and treatment, 4 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) models simulated US breast cancer mortality rates. Death due to breast cancer, overall and by estrogen receptor and ERBB2 (formerly HER2) status, among women aged 30 to 79 years in the US from 1975 to 2019 was simulated. Exposures: Screening mammography, treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Model-estimated age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate associated with screening, stage I to III treatment, and metastatic treatment relative to the absence of these exposures was assessed, as was model-estimated median survival after breast cancer metastatic recurrence. Results: The breast cancer mortality rate in the US (age adjusted) was 48/100000 women in 1975 and 27/100000 women in 2019. In 2019, the combination of screening, stage I to III treatment, and metastatic treatment was associated with a 58% reduction (model range, 55%-61%) in breast cancer mortality. Of this reduction, 29% (model range, 19%-33%) was associated with treatment of metastatic breast cancer, 47% (model range, 35%-60%) with treatment of stage I to III breast cancer, and 25% (model range, 21%-33%) with mammography screening. Based on simulations, the greatest change in survival after metastatic recurrence occurred between 2000 and 2019, from 1.9 years (model range, 1.0-2.7 years) to 3.2 years (model range, 2.0-4.9 years). Median survival for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/ERBB2-positive breast cancer improved by 2.5 years (model range, 2.0-3.4 years), whereas median survival for ER-/ERBB2- breast cancer improved by 0.5 years (model range, 0.3-0.8 years). Conclusions and Relevance: According to 4 simulation models, breast cancer screening and treatment in 2019 were associated with a 58% reduction in US breast cancer mortality compared with interventions in 1975. Simulations suggested that treatment for stage I to III breast cancer was associated with approximately 47% of the mortality reduction, whereas treatment for metastatic breast cancer was associated with 29% of the reduction and screening with 25% of the reduction..},

For biennial screening, the cumulative probability of a false-positive recall was significantly lower for tomosynthesis vs digital mammography (35.7% vs 38.1%; difference, -2.4; 95% CI, -3.4 to -1.5), but cumulative probabilities did not differ significantly by modality for short-interval follow-up recommendation (10.3% vs 10.5%; difference, -0.1; 95% CI, -0.7 to 0.5) or biopsy recommendation (6.6% vs 6.7%; difference, -0.1; 95% CI, -0.5 to 0.4). Decreases in cumulative probabilities of false-positive results with tomosynthesis vs digital mammography were largest for annual screening in women with nondense breasts (differences for recall, -6.5 to -12.8; short-interval follow-up, 0.1 to -5.2; and biopsy recommendation, -0.5 to -3.1). Regardless of modality, cumulative probabilities of false-positive results were substantially lower for biennial vs annual screening (overall recall, 35.7 to 38.1 vs 49.6 to 56.3; short-interval follow-up, 10.3 to 10.5 vs 16.6 to 17.8; and biopsy recommendation, 6.6 to 6.7 vs 11.2 to 11.7); older vs younger age groups (eg, among annual screening in women ages 70-79 vs 40-49, recall, 39.8 to 47.0 vs 60.8 to 68.0; short-interval follow-up, 13.3 to 14.2 vs 20.7 to 20.9; and biopsy recommendation, 9.1 to 9.3 vs 13.2 to 13.4); and women with entirely fatty vs extremely dense breasts (eg, among annual screening in women aged 50-59 years, recall, 29.1 to 36.3 vs 58.8 to 60.4; short-interval follow-up, 8.9 to 11.6 vs 19.5 to 19.8; and biopsy recommendation, 4.9 to 8.0 vs 15.1 to 15.3). Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness study, 10-year cumulative probabilities of false-positive results were lower on digital breast tomosynthesis vs digital mammography. Biennial screening interval, older age, and nondense breasts were associated with larger reductions in false-positive probabilities than screening modality..},

Patients were classified into four breast density groups based on their MRIs. Optical scattering properties were assigned based on average values obtained from these density groups, and MRI-guided NIRST images were reconstructed from calibrated CW data. Total hemoglobin (HbT) contrast between suspected lesions and surrounding normal tissue was used as an indicator of the malignancy. Results obtained from simulations and twenty-four patient cases indicate that the diagnostic power when using only CW data to differentiate malignant from benign abnormalities is similar to that obtained from combined frequency domain (FD) and CW data. These findings suggest that eliminating FD detection to reduce the cost and complexity of MRI-guided NIRST is possible.},

Diffuse optical tomography has demonstrated significant potential for clinical utility in the diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer, and its use in combination with other structural imaging modalities improves lesion localization and the quantification of functional tissue properties. Here, we introduce a hybrid diffuse optical imaging system that operates concurrently with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the imaging suite, utilizing commercially available MR surface coils. The instrument acquires both continuous-wave and time-domain diffuse optical data in the parallel-plate geometry, permitting both absolute assignment of tissue optical properties and three-dimensional tomography; moreover, the instrument is designed to incorporate diffuse correlation spectroscopic measurements for probing tissue blood flow. The instrument is described in detail here. Image reconstructions of a tissue phantom are presented as an initial indicator of the system's ability to accurately reconstruct optical properties and the concrete benefits of the spatial constraints provided by concurrent MRI. Last, we briefly discuss how various data combinations that the instrument could facilitate, including tissue perfusion, can enable more comprehensive assessment of lesion physiology.},

The use of structural lesion priors derived from clinical breast imaging methods, such as mammography, can improve recovery of tumor optical contrast; however, accurate lesion prior placement is essential to take full advantage of prior-guided DOT image reconstruction. Simultaneous optical and anatomical imaging may not always be possible or desired, which can make the accurate registration of the lesion prior challenging. In this paper, we present a three-step lesion prior scanning approach to facilitate improved accuracy in lesion localization based on the optical contrast quantified by the total hemoglobin concentration (HbT) for non-simultaneous multimodal DOT and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging. In three challenging breast cancer patient cases, where no clear optical contrast was present initially, we have demonstrated consistent improvement in the recovered HbT lesion contrast by utilizing this method.},

   abstract = {© 2018 Optical Society of America. Near-infrared diffuse optical tomography (NIR-DOT) is an emerging technology that offers hemoglobin based, functional imaging tumor biomarkers for breast cancer management. The most promising clinical translation opportunities are in the differential diagnosis of malignant vs. benign lesions, and in early response assessment and guidance for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Accurate quantification of the tissue oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration across the field of view, as well as repeatability during longitudinal imaging in the context of therapy guidance, are essential for the successful translation of NIR-DOT to clinical practice. The ill-posed and ill-condition nature of the DOT inverse problem makes this technique particularly susceptible to model errors that may occur, for example, when the experimental conditions do not fully match the assumptions built into the image reconstruction process. To evaluate the susceptibility of DOT images to experimental errors that might be encountered in practice for a parallel-plate NIR-DOT system, we simulated 7 different types of errors, each with a range of magnitudes. We generated simulated data by using digital breast phantoms derived from five actual mammograms of healthy female volunteers, to which we added a 1-cm tumor. After applying each of the experimental error types and magnitudes to the simulated measurements, we reconstructed optical images with and without structural prior guidance and assessed the overall error in the total hemoglobin concentrations (HbT) and in the HbT contrast between the lesion and surrounding area vs. the best-case scenarios. It is found that slight in-plane probe misalignment and plate rotation did not result in large quantification errors. However, any out-of-plane probe tilting could result in significant deterioration in lesion contrast. Among the error types investigated in this work, optical images were the least likely to be impacted by breast shape inaccuracies but suffered the largest deterioration due to cross-talk between signal channels. However, errors in optical images could be effectively controlled when experimental parameters were properly estimated during data acquisition and accounted for in the image processing procedure. Finally, optical images recovered using structural priors were, in general, less susceptible to experimental errors; however, lesion contrasts were more sensitive to errors when tumor locations were used as a priori info. Findings in this simulation study can provide guidelines for system design and operation in optical breast imaging studies.},

To take full advantage of the readily available sub-millimeter resolution structural information in a multi-modal imaging setting, an efficient x-ray/optical joint image reconstruction model has been proposed previously to utilize anatomical information from a mammogram as a structural prior. In this work, we develop a complex digital breast phantom (available at http://openjd.sf.net/digibreast) based on direct measurements of fibroglandular tissue volume fractions using dual-energy mammographic imaging of a human breast. We also extend our prior-guided reconstruction algorithm to facilitate the recovery of breast tumors, and perform a series of simulation-based studies to systematically evaluate the impact of lesion sizes and contrasts, tissue background, mesh resolution, inaccurate priors, and regularization parameters, on the recovery of breast tumors using multi-modal DOT/x-ray measurements. Our studies reveal that the optical property estimation error can be reduced by half by utilizing structural priors; the minimum detectable tumor size can also be reduced by half when prior knowledge regarding the tumor location is provided. Moreover, our algorithm is shown to be robust to false priors on tumor location.},

Recent developments in high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) have demonstrated capabilities for mapping human cortical brain function over an extended field of view with image quality approaching that of fMRI. In this review, we cover fundamental principles of the diffusion of near infrared light in biological tissue. We discuss the challenges involved in the HD-DOT system design and implementation that must be overcome to acquire the signal-to-noise necessary to measure and locate brain function at the depth of the cortex. We discuss strategies for validation of the sensitivity, specificity, and reliability of HD-DOT acquired maps of cortical brain function. We then provide a brief overview of some clinical applications of HD-DOT.

   abstract = { We present a wide-field illumination time-domain (TD) diffusion optical tomography (DOT) for three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction within a shallow region under the illuminated surface of the turbid medium. The methodological foundation is laid on the single-pixel spatial frequency domain (SFD) imaging that facilitates the adoption of the well-established time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)-based TD detection and generalized pulse spectrum techniques (GPST)-based reconstruction. To ameliorate the defects of the conventional diffusion equation (DE) in the forward modeling of TD-SFD-DOT, mainly the low accuracy in the near-field region and in profiling early-photon migration, we propose a modified model employing the time-dependent δ-P 1 approximation and verify its improved accuracy in comparison with both the Monte Carlo and DE-based ones. For a simplified inversion process, a modified GPST approach is extended to TD-SFD-DOT that enables the effective separation of the absorption and scattering coefficients using a steady-state equivalent strategy. Furthermore, we set up a single-pixel TD-SFD-DOT system that employs the TCSPC-based TD detection in the SFD imaging framework. For assessments of the reconstruction approach and the system performance, phantom experiments are performed for a series of scenarios. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for rapid 3-D reconstruction of the absorption and scattering coefficients within a depth range of about 5 mean free pathlengths. },

First a unifying characterization of various regularization methods is given and it is shown that the measurement of "size" is dependent on the particular regularization method chosen. For example, the 2-norm is appropriate for Tikhonov regularization, but a 1-norm in the coordinate system of the singular value decomposition (SVD) is relevant to truncated SVD regularization. Second, a new method is proposed for choosing the regularization parameter based on the L-curve, and it is shown how this method can be implemented efficiently.

DOS-measured absorption spectra are used to determine the tissue concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin (Hb-R), oxyhemoglobin (Hb-O 2 ), lipid, and water (H 2 O), as well as to provide an index of tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (S t O 2 ). Tissue-scattering spectra provide insight into epithelial, collagen, and lipid contributions to breast density. Clinical studies of women with malignant tumors show that DOS is sensitive to processes such as increased tissue vascularization, hypoxia, and edema. In studies of healthy women, DOS detects variations in breast physiology associated with menopausal status, menstrual cycle changes, and hormone replacement. Current research involves using DOS to monitor tumor response to therapy and the co-registration of DOS with magnetic resonance imaging. By correlating DOS-derived parameters with lesion pathology and specific molecular markers, we anticipate that composite “tissue optical indices” can be developed that non-invasively characterize both tumor and normal breast-tissue function. },

In order to evaluate the utility of DOI, we are developing broadband diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) to characterize the functional origins of optical signals in breast cancer patients. Broadband DOS combines multifrequency intensity-modulated and continuous-wave near-infrared light to quantify tissue absorption and scattering spectra from 650 to 1000 nm. Values of intrinsic physiological properties (oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, water, lipid, and scatter power) derived from absorption and scattering spectra provide detailed information on breast physiology. We present the results of clinical studies of 58 stage II/III malignant breast tumors using a noninvasive, handheld, broadband DOS probe. On average, eight positions were scanned over tumor and contralateral normal breast for each subject. Intrinsic physiological properties were statistically significantly different for malignant vs. normal tissues for all subjects, without patient age or tumor size/type stratification. Breast tissues containing malignant tumors displayed reduced lipid content ( approximately 20%) and increased water, deoxy-, and oxy-hemoglobin (>50% each) compared to normal breast tissues. Functional perturbations by the tumor were significantly larger than functional variations in normal tissues. A tissue optical index (TOI) derived from intrinsic physiological properties yielded an average two-fold contrast difference between malignant tumors and intrinsic tissue properties. Our results demonstrate that intrinsic optical signals can be influenced by functional perturbations characteristic of malignant transformation; cellular metabolism, extracellular matrix composition, and angiogenesis. Our findings further underscore the importance of broadband measurements and patient age stratification in breast cancer DOI.},

This initial study explores time domain diffuse optical imaging as an adjunct method to classify non-invasively malignant vs benign breast lesions. We estimated differences in tissue composition (oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, lipid, water, collagen) and absorption properties between lesion and average healthy tissue in the same breast applying a perturbative approach to optical images collected at 7 red-near infrared wavelengths (635–1060 nm) from subjects bearing breast lesions. The Discrete AdaBoost procedure, a machine-learning algorithm, was then exploited to classify lesions based on optically derived information (either tissue composition or absorption) and risk factors obtained from patient’s anamnesis (age, body mass index, familiarity, parity, use of oral contraceptives, and use of Tamoxifen). Collagen content, in particular, turned out to be the most important parameter for discrimination. Based on the initial results of this study the proposed method deserves further investigation. },

   abstract = {We describe what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first pilot study of coregistered tomographic x-ray and optical breast imaging. The purpose of this pilot study is to develop both hardware and data processing algorithms for a multimodality imaging method that provides information that neither x-ray nor diffuse optical tomography (DOT) can provide alone. We present in detail the instrumentation and algorithms developed for this multimodality imaging. We also present results from our initial pilot clinical tests. These results demonstrate that strictly coregistered x-ray and optical images enable a detailed comparison of the two images. This comparison will ultimately lead to a better understanding of the relationship between the functional contrast afforded by optical imaging and the structural contrast provided by x-ray imaging.

   abstract = {Images of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation are presented from multispectral near-infrared tomographic measurements in the breast of a woman with an invasive cancer. Images of the absorption coefficient and reduced scattering coefficient are recovered from the measured data using a finite element reconstruction algorithm based on the frequency-domain diffusion equation. Three methods of recovering the hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation images are presented which compensate for water and lipid absorption in different ways: (1) an assumed bulk content of water and lipids is used, (2) four chromophores are imaged, and (3) scattering power data are applied to deduce water and lipid images. In all three cases, a large increase in the hemoglobin concentration (3:1) is observed at the location of the cancer while a maximum of 15% difference is observed in the hemoglobin images between each of these methods for water and lipid compensation.},

   abstract = {Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) non-invasively measures the functional characteristics of breast lesions using near infrared light to probe tissue optical properties. This study aimed to evaluate a new digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)/DOT fusion imaging technique and obtain preliminary data for breast cancer detection. Twenty-eight women were prospectively enrolled and underwent both DBT and DOT examinations. DBT/DOT fusion imaging was created after acquisition of both examinations. Two breast radiologists analyzed DBT and DOT images independently, and then finally evaluated the fusion images. The diagnostic performance of each reading session was compared and interobserver agreement was assessed. The technical success rate was 96.4%, with one failure due to an error during DOT data storage. Among the 27 women finally included in the analysis, 13 had breast cancer. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for DBT were 0.783 and 0.854 for readers 1 and 2, respectively. DOT showed comparable diagnostic performance to DBT for both readers. The AUCs were significantly improved (P = 0.004) when the DBT/DOT fusion images were used. Interobserver agreements were highest for the DBT/DOT fusion images. In conclusion, this study suggests that DBT/DOT fusion imaging technique appears to be a promising tool for breast cancer diagnosis.},

@article{Krishnaswamy2012,
   abstract = {A Near Infrared Spectral Tomography (NIRST) system has been developed and integrated into a commercial Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) scanner to allow structural and functional imaging of breast in vivo. The NIRST instrument uses an 8-wavelength continuous wave (CW) laser-based scanning source assembly and a 75-element silicon photodiode solid-state detector panel to produce dense spectral and spatial projection data from which spectrally constrained 3D tomographic images of tissue chromophores are produced. Integration of the optical imaging system into the DBT scanner allows direct co-registration of the optical and DBT images, while also facilitating the synergistic use of x-ray contrast as anatomical priors in optical image reconstruction. Currently, the total scan time for a combined NIRST-DBT exam is ~50s with data collection from 8 wavelengths in the optical scan requiring ~42s to complete. The system was tested in breast simulating phantoms constructed using intralipid and blood in an agarose matrix with a 3 cm x 2 cm cylindrical inclusion at 1 cm depth from the surface. Diffuse image reconstruction of total hemoglobin (HbT) concentration resulted in accurate recovery of the lateral size and position of the inclusion to within 6% and 8%, respectively. Use of DBT structural priors in the NIRST reconstruction process improved the quantitative accuracy of the HbT recovery, and led to linear changes in imaged versus actual contrast, underscoring the advantages of dual-modality optical imaging approaches. The quantitative accuracy of the system can be further improved with independent measurements of scattering properties through integration of frequency or time domain data.Combined optical imaging and mammography of the healthy breast: optical contrast derived from breast structure and compression,"},

abstract = {A multispectral direct chromophore and scattering reconstruction technique has been implemented for near-infrared frequency-domain tomography in recovering images of total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, water, and scatter parameters. The method applies the spectral constraint of the chromophores and scattering spectra directly in the reconstruction algorithm, thereby reducing the parameter space of the inversion process. This new method was validated by use of simulated and experimental data, and results show better robustness and stability in the presence of higher levels of noise. The method suppresses artifacts, especially those significant in water and scatter power images, and reduces cross talk between chromophore and scatter parameters. Variation in scattering was followed by this spectral approach successfully in experimental data from 90-mm-diameter cylindrical phantoms, and results show linear variation in scatter amplitude and reduced scattering coefficient ($\mu$s$\prime$), with total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and water remaining constant and quantitatively accurate. Similar experiments were carried out for varying oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin. Accurate quantification was obtained with a mean error of 7.7\% for oxygen saturation and 6.2\% for total hemoglobin, with minimal cross talk between different parameters.},
